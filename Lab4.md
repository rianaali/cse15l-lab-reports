### Below I will summarize the keys pressed to speed up the challenge tasks listed in Week 7's Lab
1. Log into ieng6

    #### Keys Pressed: 
    ``<up> <enter>``
  
    #### Summary: 
    For this first task, the command to log into my ssh account (cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu), was one up my search history. As a result, I used     the arrow key once then pressed enter. Since I generated an SSH key on my computer as well, I automated my login and was not prompted for a     password.
  
2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

    #### Keys Pressed: 
    ``<Ctrl + V> <enter>``
  
    #### Summary: 
   For this first task, I simply pasted the command which clones the lab7 repository I have previously forked. The command was already copied on 
   my computer's clipboard.
  
3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

    ``<up><up><up><up><up><enter>``
  
    #### Summary: 
     The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java command was 5 up in the search history. I used up arrow key 4 times  
     in order to access then enter it. Similarly, the java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore      
    ListExamplesTest command was 4 up in the history, so I accessed and ran it in the same way.
