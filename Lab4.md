# Lab 4: Running through challenge tasks
### Below I will summarize the keys pressed to speed up the challenge tasks listed in Week 7's Lab
1. Log into ieng6
  
    #### Keys Pressed: 
    ``<Ctrl + V> <enter>``
  
    #### Summary: 
    For this first task, I simply pasted the command which logs me into my ieng6 account (ssh    
    cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu), which was already saved onto my computer. Since I generated an SSH key on my computer as well, I 
    automated my login and was not prompted for a password.

5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
  
    #### Keys Pressed:

7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
  
    #### Keys Pressed:
